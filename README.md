# Scrabble

Command-line multiplayer scrabble implementation realized for a software engineering assignment with two fellows. The code contained in "Assignment5" (Bot.java excluded) was given as solution by the professor, and we had to realize the bot based on that. Our solution can be found in the "scrabBot" package. For the bot, we used the GADDAG solution as in the majority of scrabble's engines. Unit and complete tests can be found in the "test" directory.
